Quoting variables in [...] or [[ ... ]]
like if/else statements
is considered safe practice

for example
$a = "akshat"

if [ $a ] X
if [ "$a" ] correct use.(recommeneded)


DISK_USAGE_ALERT.sh

df -h /| awk 'NR==2 {print $5}' | tr -d '%'

df -h / → checks only the root filesystem.

awk 'NR==2 {print $5}' -> extracts the 5th column (use percentage).
NR==2 means “when the line number is 2”.

tr -d '%' → tells tr to delete every % character from its input.

tr stands for “translate” or “transform”.
It reads from standard input and replaces or deletes characters as instructed.

-d means delete


LOG_ROTATION.sh

1. Find files by name
find /path/to/search -name "filename.txt"

Searches in /path/to/search for files named filename.txt.

2. Find files by extension
find /home/user/Documents -type f -name "*.pdf"

Finds all PDF files in /home/user/Documents.

3. Find directories by name
find /var/www -type d -name "html"

Finds directories named html under /var/www.

4. Find files modified in the last 7 days
find /home/user -type f -mtime -7

-mtime 7 exactly 7 days
-mtime +7 more than 7 days
-mtime -7 withing 7 days

5. Find commands not piped as it doesnot take the putput of previous that why we can use multi filter in one commands
find | find (not work, out is of the second find alone)

multi filter together
find /var/log -type f -name "*.log" -mtime +7
(it will find the files of type (.log) which has modified more than 7 days ago)

6. Execute a command on found files
find /var/log -type f -name "*.log" -mtime +7 -exec rm {} \;

1️⃣ How -exec works

-exec lets you run a command on each file that find finds.
Syntax:
find <path> <conditions> -exec <command> {} \;

Where:
{} → is a placeholder for the filename that find found.
\; → marks the end of the -exec command. (The backslash escapes the semicolon for the shell.)

to check the size of .zip file or to check if its empty or not
ls -lh "logs_2025-10-10T17:18:00.tar.gz"

use "" when : is present in file_name
